%% WHAT'S THIS CODE:
%  This is a 3D ray tracing algorithm for indoor radio propagation based on
%  reflecting image methods. This accounts for transmission, primary and
%  secondary reflection of a beam.
%  I tried to make this as easy as possible to use and had to make some
%  assumptions and compromises. 
%  I have included a couple of examples that can be used, to give you an
%  insight of how this works. 
%  Code is not optimized, and perhaps far from it, however that's as much
%  as time a had to spend on it, so apologies for messy plot mechanism 
%  and ... 
%  In case you've any questions or got into trouble, feel free to contact
%  me, hosseinzadeh.88@gmail.com

%% HOW THIS WORKS!

% 
% Defining The Structure:
% 1 - Walls must be rectangular/square. No curved walls/panels are allowed
% 
% There are two ways to define walls or structure
% 1- Method one (easy 2D to 3D):
%       This is the easy way of doing it. If the walls are all of the same
%       height (ususally are), ignore their height and think of them as
%       lines to make it 2D. Lets say walls height is 4 metters, then
%       change "ceilingLevel = 4".
%       -So, now walls are lines, and they have 2
%       ends. You can define them as a CSV file now. Each wall has a start
%       and a end defined by [Xstart,Ystart,Zstart] and [Xend,Yend,Zend].
%       -Ignore Zstart and Zend, they are always zero. 
%       -Lets say the reference point of start is [0,0,0], this is where
%       the first wall starts from, and it end point is at [36,0,0]. The
%       first line in the excel or CSV file then should look like this.
%       0  ;0  ;0     
%       36 ;0  ;0 
%       
%       Where first line of csv or excel is for the start point of wall 1 and next line (line 2) of the excel/csv file isthe end
%       point of wall 1. As continues the 3rd line should be the start
%       point of wall 2 and 4th line should be the end point of wall 2.
%       An excel file is attached to the submission to give an examle.
% 
% 
% 2- Method 2: 
%       I have another submission that extract the walls automatically, use
%       that to extract all the walls automatically from a 2D image of an
%       structure.
%       Method 1 is simple enough so I skip this.
% 
% 
% 3- Defining the Ceiling or floor:
%      - IMPORTANT: MANUAL DEFINITION OF CEILING NEEDS TO BE CLOCKWISE OR
%      COUNTER CLOCKWIESE!
%       Assuming that there are few cilings to be defined or can be ignored
%       this is totally manual.
%       - Each piece of ceiling is defined with 4 coreners, ceillFloor.xyz1
%       ceillFloor.xyz2, ceillFloor.xyz3 and ceillFloor.xyz4. Each variable
%       contains x,y,z of first, 2nd, 3rd and 4th corner. This is similar
%       for defining the ground!
% 
%       Here is an example that defines 2 pieces of ceiling panels and 1
%       ground
% 
%     ceillFloor.xyz1 = [0,0,ceilingLevel
%                        31,23,ceilingLevel
%                        0,0,groundLevel
%                         ];
% 
%     ceillFloor.xyz2 = [0,23.9,ceilingLevel
%                         31.83,27.83,ceilingLevel
%                         0,27.54,groundLevel
% 
%                         ];
% 
%     ceillFloor.xyz3 = [36.9,23.9,ceilingLevel
%                         36.9,27.83,ceilingLevel
%                         36.9,27.54,groundLevel
%                         ];
% 
%     ceillFloor.xyz4 = [36.9,0,ceilingLevel
%                         36.9,23.9,ceilingLevel
%                         36.9,0,groundLevel
%                         ];

% 
%  !!!! DONT FORGET THEY NEED TO BE COLOCKWISE OTHER WISE THEY STRUCTURE
%  THAT WILL BE VIEWED IS GOING TO BE A FUNNY MESS !!!
% 
% 4 - Defining Relative Permittivity:
%       Each wall, floor and ground pannel has it's own premittivity. To
%       assign them, set the demoMode to 1, (demoMode =1) it will show you
%       all the walls and their number. Simply assign each wall ceiling and
%       floor a value in "wall.relativePerm". 
%       - The ceiling and floor are appended to the end of the walls, so
%       if you have 2 walls, 2 ceilings and 1 floor you need a total of 5
%       permittivities to be assigned.
%       - Ceilings and floor is always appeneded to the end so the last
%       premittivities are for the ceiling and floor. In this example
%       - wall.relativePerm(end) is the permittivity of floor
%       - wall.relativePerm(end-1) is the permittivity of the second
%       ceiling 
%       - wall.relativePerm(end-2) is the permittivity of the 1st ceiling
% 
% 
% 5- When polarizationSwap == 1 (Antenna has vertical polarization)
% therefore:
%    (S polarization, Vertical polarization, Transverse Electric polarization, Perpendicular polarization) coefficients are used for walls
%    (P Polarization, Horizontal polarization, Transverse Magnetic polarization, Parallel Polarization) coefficients are used for ceiling and floor
% 
% 
% 6- Antenna Gain:
%       Gain of transcievers can be defined mathematically in the
%       "AntennaTemp.m" file. I've done it for a simple dipole antenna. And
%       the gain is pre-calculted in the same file for different angles,
%       depending on which resolution you assing. The example pattern is
%       showing a dipole in x=0,y=0,z=1 direction.
% 
% 7- When polarizationSwap == 0 (Antenna has horizontal polarization)
%    (S polarization, Vertical polarization, Transverse Electric polarization, Perpendicular polarization) coefficients are used for CEILING and FLOOR
%    (P Polarization, Horizontal polarization, Transverse Magnetic polarization, Parallel Polarization) coefficients are used for WALLS
% 
% 
% 8- There can be more than one Tx in the environment Tx = [x,y,z;x2,y2,z2]. However for this to work you need to change the code.
